## MIPS Simulator (Prof. Preeti Ranjan Panda, Course Project) (March, 2021 - May, 2021)
- Developed a MIPS Simulator with support of a subset of instructions of the MIPS instruction set.
- Designed a Memory Request Manager to handle memory requests between a multi-core CPU and the DRAM.
- Added features like non-blocking memory, data forwarding, and memory request reordering to increase throughput.

1. Run `make all`.
2. Use `./sim <filename>` .
